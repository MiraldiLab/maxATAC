    Benchmark a bigwig file of TF binding predictions against a gold standard file of predictions

    The inputs need to be in bigwig format to use this function. You can also provide a different blacklist to filter
    out regions that you do not want to include in your comparison. We use a np.mask to exclude these regions.

    Currently, benchmarking is set up for one chromosome at a time. The most time consuming step is importing and
    binning the input bigwig files to resolutions smaller than 100bp. We are also only benchmarking on whole chromosome
    at the moment so everything not in the blacklist will be considered a potential region.
    ___________________
    Workflow Overview

    1) Set up directories and names for this project
    2) Get the blacklist mask using the input blacklist and bin it at the same resolution as the predictions and GS
    3) Calculate the AUPR per chromosome

    :param args: output_directory, prefix, bin_size, prediction, gold_standard, chromosomes, agg_function,
    round_predictions

    :return: A tsv file of precision and recall with AUPR
